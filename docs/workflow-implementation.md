# TEN Platform Workflow Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of our GitHub Issues-based workflow and branching strategy for The Experiences Network (TEN) platform.

## GitHub Issues Structure

### Issue Types
1. `[Env]`: Environment and workflow management
2. `[Feature]`: New functionality
3. `[Bug]`: Error fixes
4. `[Enhancement]`: Improvements
5. `[Security]`: Security updates
6. `[Performance]`: Optimization work

### Component Tags
- `[Frontend]`: Client-side changes
- `[Backend]`: Server-side changes

### Priority Levels
- `#P0`: Critical/Blocking
- `#P1`: High Priority
- `#P2`: Medium Priority
- `#P3`: Low Priority

## Branch Management

### Main Branches
```
├── main (Production-ready code)
└── develop (Integration branch)
```

### Issue-Based Branches
Format: `issue-XXX-brief-description`
Example: `issue-001-auth-system`

### Hotfix Branches
Format: `hotfix-XXX-brief-description`
Example: `hotfix-002-db-connection`

## Environment-Specific Configuration

### Replit Environment
- Pull Strategy: Rebase
- Branch Protection: Enabled
- Required Reviews: 1
- Status Checks: Required

### Windsurf Environment
- Pull Strategy: Fast-forward
- Branch Protection: Enabled
- Required Reviews: 1
- Status Checks: Required

## Workflow Process

1. Issue Creation
   - Create issue using standard template
   - Assign priority and component tags
   - Link related issues/PRs

2. Branch Creation
   - Create from `develop` branch
   - Use issue-based naming convention
   - Include issue number in commits

3. Development Process
   - Regular commits with clear messages
   - Include issue number in commit messages
   - Cross-environment testing

4. Review Process
   - Create PR to `develop`
   - Link related issues
   - Request reviews
   - Address feedback

5. Integration
   - Merge to `develop`
   - Delete feature branch
   - Close related issues

6. Production Release
   - Create PR from `develop` to `main`
   - Comprehensive testing
   - Deploy to production

## Cross-Environment Synchronization

### Database Sync Process
1. Verify schema compatibility
2. Run sync validation
3. Execute sync operation
4. Verify data consistency

### Branch Sync Process
1. Check environment configuration
2. Apply appropriate pull strategy
3. Resolve conflicts if any
4. Verify sync completion

## Documentation Requirements

### Issue Documentation
- Clear description
- Technical approach
- Environment considerations
- Acceptance criteria

### PR Documentation
- Changes summary
- Test results
- Environment impacts
- Deployment notes

## Best Practices

1. Issue Management
   - Keep issues focused and atomic
   - Update status regularly
   - Link related issues
   - Document environment-specific details

2. Branch Management
   - Regular rebases with develop
   - Clean commit history
   - Clear commit messages
   - Environment-aware merges

3. Documentation
   - Keep docs up to date
   - Include examples
   - Document edge cases
   - Cross-reference related docs

4. Cross-Environment Development
   - Test in both environments
   - Document env-specific issues
   - Verify sync operations
   - Monitor performance impacts
