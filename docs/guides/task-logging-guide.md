# Task Work Log Guide

This guide explains how to effectively use the Jira task work log template to document your development work.

## Overview

The task work log serves several important purposes:
1. Tracks progress and decisions made during development
2. Provides context for code reviewers and future maintainers
3. Documents technical decisions and their rationale
4. Captures best practices and lessons learned
5. Ensures consistent documentation across the project

## Getting Started

1. When starting a new Jira task:
   - Create a new file in `/task_work_logs/[JIRA-ID]_work_log.md`
   - Copy the template from `/docs/templates/jira-task-log-template.md`
   - Fill in the initial sections (Task Information, Description)

2. Update the log regularly:
   - Add progress updates as you work
   - Document decisions as they're made
   - Note any blockers or dependencies discovered

## Section-by-Section Guide

### Task Information
- **Started**: Use the exact time you begin work
- **Status**: Keep this updated as the task progresses
- **Description**: Brief but clear explanation of the task

### Task Structure
- Document parent-child relationships between tasks
- Track subtask progress
- Include assignees and current status

### Implementation Details
- List all files created or modified
- Document dependencies with their purpose and status
- Note required environment variables

### Progress Updates
- Date and timestamp each update
- Focus on concrete achievements
- Include metrics where relevant (e.g., test coverage)
- Note any blockers or issues encountered

### Development Progress
- Track completed features with specific details
- Maintain current status information
- Document testing coverage and scenarios
- List clear next steps

### Technical Documentation
- Document architecture and design decisions
- Include rationale for important choices
- Share best practices and guidelines
- Note related tasks and dependencies

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Updates**
   - Update the log as you work, not after
   - Include timestamps with all updates
   - Document decisions when they're made

2. **Clear Communication**
   - Use clear, concise language
   - Include specific details (file names, function names)
   - Document both successes and challenges

3. **Comprehensive Documentation**
   - Include all dependencies
   - Document environment requirements
   - Note related tasks and impacts

4. **Testing Information**
   - Document test coverage
   - Include specific test scenarios
   - Note any testing limitations

## Template Usage Example

See [TENP-73_work_log.md](/task_work_logs/TENP-73_work_log.md) for a complete example of a well-documented task using this template.

## Review Checklist

Before considering a task complete, ensure:
- [ ] All sections are filled out appropriately
- [ ] Progress updates are clear and timestamped
- [ ] Technical decisions are documented
- [ ] Dependencies and requirements are listed
- [ ] Testing information is complete
- [ ] Best practices are documented
- [ ] Related tasks are updated

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Incomplete Updates**
   - Missing timestamps
   - Vague progress descriptions
   - Undocumented decisions

2. **Missing Context**
   - No rationale for decisions
   - Missing dependency information
   - Unclear task relationships

3. **Poor Organization**
   - Mixed chronological updates
   - Duplicate information
   - Missing sections

4. **Insufficient Detail**
   - Vague descriptions
   - Missing file paths
   - Incomplete testing information

## Maintaining the Log

1. **Regular Reviews**
   - Review the log before each commit
   - Update status and progress regularly
   - Keep next steps current

2. **Final Review**
   - Complete the review checklist
   - Ensure all sections are filled
   - Update related task references

3. **Knowledge Sharing**
   - Document lessons learned
   - Share best practices
   - Note common pitfalls

Remember: A well-maintained task log is invaluable for code reviews, future maintenance, and team knowledge sharing.
