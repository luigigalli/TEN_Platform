### Task: TENP-73 - Fix Type Issues in Middleware
**Status**: Done

#### Work Done
1. Analyzed existing codebase and identified issues:
   - Type inconsistencies in middleware
   - Outdated code structure
   - Complex dependencies

2. Made strategic decision to clean up codebase:
   - Removed application-specific code
   - Kept essential infrastructure
   - Simplified middleware setup

3. Preserved key components:
   - Testing infrastructure
   - Database schema
   - Configuration system
   - Error handling
   - Basic Express setup

4. Created minimal working setup:
   - Basic middleware (security, CORS, body parsing)
   - Health check endpoint
   - Clean routing structure
   - Type-safe request handling

5. Verified functionality:
   - All tests passing
   - Health check working
   - Middleware chain intact

#### Technical Details
- Updated middleware to use proper TypeScript types
- Simplified routing structure
- Added helmet for security
- Maintained test coverage

#### Next Steps
- Ready to implement new features on clean foundation
- Continue with test-driven development
- Maintain high type safety standards

#### Related Tasks

### Task: Database Migration and Server Startup Fixes
**Status**: Done

#### Work Done
1. Fixed server startup in app.ts:
   - Added code to call createApp() when run directly
   - Implemented proper error handling and logging
   - Verified server starts correctly

2. Restructured database migrations:
   - Created new users table migration (0000_create_users.sql)
   - Reordered existing migrations to ensure proper dependencies:
     - 0001_messages.sql (was 0000_messages.sql)
     - 0002_update_messages.sql (was 0001_update_messages.sql)
     - 0003_update_user_schema.sql (was 0001_update_user_schema.sql)
     - 0004_nullable_firstname.sql (was 0002_nullable_firstname.sql)
     - 0005_required_firstname.sql (was 0003_required_firstname.sql)
   - Updated journal file with correct order and timestamps
   - Verified migrations run successfully

3. Testing:
   - Confirmed database migrations work in correct order
   - Verified server starts and responds to requests
   - Tested "Hello World!" functionality
   - Health endpoint returns expected response

#### Technical Details
- Migration order ensures users table exists before messages table references it
- Server startup includes proper error handling and logging
- All changes synchronized between sandbox and main development repository

#### Next Steps
- Continue with feature implementation
- Add more comprehensive tests
- Consider adding migration tests

### Task: Implement Automatic Context Refresh
**Status**: Done

#### Work Done
1. Created context refresh system:
   - Implemented scripts/refresh-context.ts to monitor critical project files
   - Added automatic refresh before git commits via pre-commit hook
   - Integrated context refresh into npm script lifecycle

2. Critical files monitored:
   - project-reference.md
   - WORK_LOG.md
   - PROJECT_BRIEF.md
   - docs/workflow.md
   - docs/database.md
   - docs/environment-guide.md

3. Integration points:
   - Pre-commit hook: Ensures context is fresh before commits
   - npm hooks: Added pre-hooks for dev, build, migrate, start, and test commands
   - Automatic refresh every 5 minutes when files change

#### Technical Details
- Uses file system watchers to detect changes
- Caches file contents to minimize disk reads
- Displays preview of changed files
- Integrated with existing logger system

#### Next Steps
- Monitor system usage and adjust refresh interval if needed
- Consider adding more critical files to monitor
- Add tests for the context refresh system

### Task: Integrate Jira Sync with Context Refresh
**Status**: Done

#### Work Done
1. Created Jira sync integration:
   - Implemented scripts/jira/jira-sync.ts for TypeScript integration
   - Added task status caching to minimize API calls
   - Integrated with existing Python-based Jira workflow

2. Key Features:
   - Automatic task detection from git branch name
   - Status caching with 5-minute TTL
   - Work log synchronization
   - Integration with context refresh system

3. Integration points:
   - Runs automatically with context refresh
   - Updates task status in Jira
   - Maintains local work logs
   - Caches task information for efficiency

#### Technical Details
- Uses branch naming convention to extract task IDs (e.g., feature/TENP-123-description)
- Caches task status to minimize Jira API calls
- Integrates with existing Python-based Jira workflow
- Updates work logs in task_work_logs directory

#### Next Steps
- Add more comprehensive error handling
- Consider adding Jira webhook support
- Implement task transition workflows
- Add tests for Jira sync functionality
