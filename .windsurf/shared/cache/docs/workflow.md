# Development Workflow Guide

This document outlines the development workflow for our application, designed to be platform-agnostic while supporting specific deployment environments.

## Branch Strategy

### Issue Types and Branch Naming
All changes must start with a GitHub issue using one of these types:

1. `[Env]` → `env/*`
   - Environment configurations
   - Workflow changes
   - Build system updates
   - CI/CD modifications

2. `[Feature]` → `feat/*`
   - New features
   - Major enhancements
   - User-facing changes

3. `[Bug]` → `fix/*`
   - Bug fixes
   - Error corrections
   - Quick patches

4. `[Enhancement]` → `enhance/*`
   - Code improvements
   - Refactoring
   - Performance optimization

5. `[Security]` → `security/*`
   - Security fixes
   - Vulnerability patches
   - Authentication changes

6. `[Performance]` → `perf/*`
   - Performance improvements
   - Optimization work
   - Resource usage enhancements

### Branch Naming Rules
- Branch names must match their issue type prefix
- Use lowercase letters and hyphens only
- Include issue number when applicable
- Keep names concise but descriptive

Examples:
- `env/issue-123-workflow-automation`
- `feat/user-authentication`
- `fix/issue-456-login-error`
- `security/password-validation`

### Protected Branches
- `main`: Production-ready code
  - Protected branch
  - Requires pull request review
  - Linear history enforced
  - Status checks must pass
- `develop`: Integration branch
  - Protected branch
  - Requires pull request review
  - Status checks must pass

## Database Synchronization Process

### Pre-Sync Checklist
1. **Environment Validation**
   - Verify both environments are accessible
   - Check database credentials
   - Validate schema compatibility
   - Ensure required fields are properly configured

2. **Data Backup**
   - Create backup of target database
   - Document current schema state
   - Note any environment-specific configurations

3. **Sync Execution**
   - Use provided sync scripts
   - Follow proper order of operations
   - Handle nullable vs required fields
   - Manage foreign key relationships

4. **Post-Sync Validation**
   - Verify data integrity
   - Check constraint compliance
   - Validate relationships
   - Confirm environment-specific settings

## Code Review Process

### Pull Request (PR) Guidelines
1. **Create Descriptive PRs**
   - Clear title describing the change
   - Detailed description of modifications
   - Link to related issues or tickets
   - List of affected environments
   - Database impact assessment (if applicable)

2. **Review Requirements**
   - At least one approval from the available environment team
   - All automated tests pass in the available environment
   - Documentation updated as needed
   - No merge conflicts with target branch
   - Database sync validation (if applicable)

3. **Environment Availability**
   - If both environments are available:
     - Reviews required from both teams
     - Tests must pass in both environments
     - Database sync must be verified
   - If one environment is unavailable:
     - Review and testing from available environment team is sufficient
     - Document any environment-specific considerations for future testing
