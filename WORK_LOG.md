### Task: TENP-72 - Set up Development Environment
**Status**: Done

#### Work Done
1. Set up basic development environment:
   - Express.js with TypeScript
   - Jest testing framework
   - Database configuration
   - Essential middleware

2. Created test infrastructure:
   - Set up Jest configuration
   - Created test utilities
   - Implemented test client
   - Added health check test as first test case

3. Verified test setup:
   - Confirmed Jest configuration working
   - Health check test passing
   - Test client functioning correctly
   - Test utilities properly integrated

#### Technical Details
- Jest configured for TypeScript
- Test client using supertest
- Health check endpoint verified
- Database utilities for testing

#### Next Steps
- Move on to implementing core features
- Continue with test-driven development
- Add more test cases as needed

#### Related Tasks
- TENP-73 (In Progress) - Fix Type Issues in Middleware
- TENP-74 (To Do) - Implement new feature requirements

### Task: TENP-73 - Fix Type Issues in Middleware
**Status**: Done

#### Work Done
1. Analyzed existing codebase and identified issues:
   - Type inconsistencies in middleware
   - Outdated code structure
   - Complex dependencies

2. Made strategic decision to clean up codebase:
   - Removed application-specific code
   - Kept essential infrastructure
   - Simplified middleware setup

3. Preserved key components:
   - Testing infrastructure
   - Database schema
   - Configuration system
   - Error handling
   - Basic Express setup

4. Created minimal working setup:
   - Basic middleware (security, CORS, body parsing)
   - Health check endpoint
   - Clean routing structure
   - Type-safe request handling

5. Verified functionality:
   - All tests passing
   - Health check working
   - Middleware chain intact

#### Technical Details
- Updated middleware to use proper TypeScript types
- Simplified routing structure
- Added helmet for security
- Maintained test coverage

#### Next Steps
- Ready to implement new features on clean foundation
- Continue with test-driven development
- Maintain high type safety standards

#### Related Tasks
- TENP-72 (Done) - Set up development environment
- TENP-74 (To Do) - Implement new feature requirements
