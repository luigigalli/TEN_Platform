Title: [Env][System] Standardize Git workflow and branch management across environments (#P1)

## Overview
Implement and standardize Git workflow and branch management system for consistent development across Replit and Windsurf environments.

## Technical Approach
- Configure environment-specific Git pull strategies
  - Replit: Rebase strategy
  - Windsurf: Fast-forward only
- Set up branch protection rules
- Implement pre-commit hooks for validation
- Update documentation for cross-environment development

## Environment Considerations
### Replit Environment
- Configure rebase-based pull strategy
- Set up environment-specific hooks
- Configure authentication for Replit

### Windsurf Environment
- Configure fast-forward only strategy
- Set up environment-specific hooks
- Handle local development setup

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Environment-specific Git configurations working correctly
- [ ] Branch protection rules enforced in both environments
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks validating branch names and commit messages
- [ ] Cross-environment sync process documented and tested
- [ ] Documentation updated with environment-specific workflows
