# Git Sync Script Enhancement Proposal

## Feature: Branch Rename Support

### Current Limitation
The git-sync.sh script currently lacks support for branch renaming operations, which is needed for maintaining proper branch categorization (feat/, fix/, env/, etc.).

### Proposed Enhancement
Add a new command to git-sync.sh:
```bash
./git-sync.sh rename <new-branch-name>
```

### Implementation Details
1. Add new command 'rename' to handle branch renaming
2. Support both local and remote branch renaming
3. Maintain existing authentication and error handling
4. Add validation for branch name prefixes
5. Include safety checks for existing branches

### Usage Example
```bash
./git-sync.sh rename env/validation-messages
```

### Safety Measures
1. Verify target branch doesn't exist
2. Backup current branch state
3. Validate branch prefix
4. Handle remote repository updates

### Next Steps
1. Implement the enhancement
2. Test in both environments
3. Update documentation
4. Add to branch management workflow
