# TENP-75 Work Log: Implement Logger and Request Middleware

## Summary
Implemented new middleware components for request logging and error handling, along with a centralized logger utility.

## Changes Made

### New Components
1. Request Logger Middleware
   - Added `server/middleware/request-logger.ts`
   - Implemented comprehensive request logging
   - Added tests in `tests/middleware/request-logger.test.ts`

2. Error Handling Middleware
   - Added `server/middleware/error.ts`
   - Standardized error handling across the application

3. Logger Utility
   - Added `server/utils/logger.ts`
   - Implemented Winston-based logging
   - Added tests in `tests/utils/logger.test.ts`

### Development Tools
- Created `scripts/sync-to-github.sh` to synchronize between local development and GitHub directories
  - Shows differences between directories
  - Syncs specific directories and files
  - Requires confirmation before making changes
  - Usage: `./scripts/sync-to-github.sh`

## Testing
All new components have comprehensive test coverage:
- Request logger middleware tests
- Logger utility tests

## Implementation Details

1. New Files:
   - `server/middleware/request-logger.ts` (Request logger middleware)
   - `server/middleware/error.ts` (Error handling middleware)
   - `server/utils/logger.ts` (Logger utility)
   - `tests/middleware/request-logger.test.ts` (Request logger middleware tests)
   - `tests/utils/logger.test.ts` (Logger utility tests)
   - `scripts/sync-to-github.sh` (Sync script)

2. Dependencies Added:
   - winston (logging)
   - winston-daily-rotate-file (log rotation)

## Next Steps
1. Add more comprehensive test coverage
2. Document logging practices in the project wiki
3. Consider adding log aggregation in production
